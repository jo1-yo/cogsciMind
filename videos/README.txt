VIDEO FOLDER
============

Place your video file here.

Recommended filename: main-lecture.mp4

Supported video formats:
- MP4 (recommended)
- WebM
- OGG

Tips:
1. MP4 has the best browser compatibility
2. Recommended resolution: 1280x720 or 1920x1080
3. Keep file size under 100MB for faster loading
4. Use video compression tools if needed

How to use:
Once you place the video file in this folder, the website will automatically play it.
Make sure the filename matches the source path in index.html (line 57):
<source src="videos/main-lecture.mp4" type="video/mp4">

If your video has a different name, either:
- Rename it to "main-lecture.mp4", or
- Edit the src attribute in index.html to match your filename
